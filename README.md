# remotion-transitions

A Claude Code skill plugin for building **custom scene transitions in Remotion** — covers the `TransitionPresentation` API from scratch, animation math, timing patterns, and a catalog of production-ready examples to learn from or drop in directly.

## Transitions

| Name | Effect | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Striped Slam** | Alternating brand-color bars slam in from both sides, then retract | Opening cuts, high-impact moments |
| **Zoom Punch** | Outgoing scene retreats; incoming punches in with cubic ease | Mid-sequence energy |
| **Diagonal Reveal** | Dark panel sweeps left→right with skewed edge and glowing accent line | Cinematic reveals |
| **Emerald Burst** | Sharp radial flash peaks at the cut, dissolves in 20% of duration | Emotional or product moments |
| **Vertical Shutter** | N vertical panels close over the old scene, then snap open | Graphic, stop-motion feel |
| **Glitch Slam** | Horizontal shake decay + RGB-offset strip tears on exit | Final cuts, CTAs |

## Installation

Once listed on the marketplace:
```
